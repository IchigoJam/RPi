		IchigoJam BASIC RPi is Raspberry Pi Edition of the software of the Kids PC "IchigoJam".<br/>
		Refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://ichigojam.net/index-en.html">https://ichigojam.net/index-en.html</a> about original (LPC1114) edition.<br/>
		IchigoJam was created to make it easy to enjoy programming in the BASIC language.<br/>
		It can also be used for electronics hobby by using functions such as digital I/O, PWM, I2C and UART.<br/>

		<h2>1. Terms of use</h2>
		<p>Agree to the <a target="_blank" href="https://ichigojam.net/ichigojam-license.pdf">Terms of use</a> before use it.
		  Distribution to third parties requires a contract.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>2. Device compatibility</h2>
		<p>
		  Basically, it should work with all models of Raspberry Pi.<br/>
		  Compatibility is confirmed with the following models.
		</p>
		<ul>
				<li>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</li>
				<li>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2</li>
				<li>Raspberry Pi Zero W V1.1</li>
				<li>Raspberry Pi Zero V1.3</li>
				<li>Raspberry Pi 2 Model B V1.2</li>
				<li>Raspberry Pi Model B+ V1.2</li>
				<li>Raspberry Pi Model A+ V1.1</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="note">
		  
		  * For some keyboards, The response of "Zero", "Zero W" and "Model A+" is not good for now.<br />
		  However, Other than that, you can use those same as "Pi 3" and "Pi 2".

		<h2>3. How to download</h2>
		<p>You can download it from here.</p>
		<p class="link"><a href="downloads/index.html">Downloads</a></p>

		<div class="block">
			<h3>Installation</h3>
			<p>
			  Using a PC, Format a microSD card with FAT16 or FAT32.<br />
			  Copy contents of the directory including readme.txt to the microSD card.
			</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>It's nice to prepare microSD card with capacity up to 32GB and use <a href="https://www.sdcard.org//downloads/formatter_4/" target="_blank">SD Memory Card Formatter</a>.</li>
			  <li>Supported file systems are FAT16 and FAT32.</li>
			  <li>If it does not work properly, the compatibility between Raspberry Pi and the microSD card may not be good.<br />
			    Please refer to [<a href="https://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards#Working_.2F_Non-working_SD_cards" target="_blank">Working / Non-working SD cards</a>] and try other cards.</li>
			</ul>
		</div><!-- /.block-->

		<div class="block">
		<h3>Update</h3>
		<p>To update to the latest version, follow the procedure below.</p>
		<p class="note">* Since updating the SAVE and LOAD command specifications to support EEPROM with ver1.2.5, it may be necessary to adjust the file name in the &quot;files&quot; directory at the time of update. Please see &quot;<a href="#save_load_specification">SAVE/LOAD Destination</a>&quot; for details.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Using a PC, copy files in the microSD memory card to the desired location.(backup)</li>
		  <li>Download and unpack the latest version of IchigoJam BASIC RPi from the download page.</li>
		  <li>Overwrite the file on the microSD card with the file generated by downloading and unpacking it.</li>
		  <li>Copy (restore) files directory, config.txt, keymap.txt from backup to microSD card.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>5. Differences from the original edition</h2>
		<p>
			IchigoJam BASIC RPi is ported based on version 1.2.4(1.2b56)(*) of the original edition (LPC1114 edition).<br/>
			The operation method and available commands are basically same as the original edition, <br/>
			but the following points are different.<br/>
			A Document of the original edition is here.
			<a target="_blank" href="https://ichigojam.net/IchigoJam-en.html">https://ichigojam.net/IchigoJam-en.html</a>
			<p class="note">* ver1.2.5 or later. Before ver1.2.4, ported based on ver1.2.3 of LPC1114 edition.</p>

		<h2>8. FAQ</h2>
		<dl>
		  <dt>Q. The screen flips vertically, when using &quot;Raspberry Pi 7 inch Touchscreen Display&quot;.</dt>
		  <dd>A. It can be adjusted by adding lcd_rotate=2 to config.txt as with Raspbian.</dd>
		  <dt>Q. There is no button on the raspberry pi, how to start the program automatically when turn on the power?</dt>
		  <dd>A. If power is turned on without connecting the keyboard, FILE0 is automatically executed (LRUN0).</dd>
		  <dt>Q. Can Composite Video (RCA terminal) be used for display output?</dt>
		  <dd>A. Yes. Similar to Raspbian, a signal is output from the 3.5 mm jack. The sound is output from the physical PIN 29 (SND).</dd>
		  <dt>Q. I want to use a Japanese keyboard.</dt>
		  <dd>A. You can switch it with the KBD command. Try KBD1.</dd>
		  <dt>Q. I want to use a US keyboard.</dt>
		  <dd>A. You can switch it with the KBD command. Try KBD0.</dd>
		  <dt>Q. Does it support analog input?</dt>
		  <dd>A. No. Use external modules such as AD Converter connecting via I2C and so on.</dd>
